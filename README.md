# Documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `Get Started`

This repository contains the source code for the [Weather Forecast App](https://62c038d6e9286500083f6632--fascinating-gelato-dc35b9.netlify.app/)!

A basic application that:

- Forecasts the weather for 5 cities (Lagos, Abuja, London, Los Angeles, Paris).
- Shows the current weather forecast for the day, and 4 days subsequently (Forecast for 5 days total).
- Gets a user's location automatically and generate a forecast based on this.
- Leverages the [Open Weather API](https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map/) to get weather information for each cities.
- Built in the following languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript (with React as a front end library choice)

### `Running Locally`

- Clone the project repository over HTTPS by running `git clone https://github.com/AregbesolaOJ/weather-forecast.git` in your directory on the local terminal.
- Create a root .env file locally by using the .env.sample file in the root directory as an example. Fill in needed variables with real values - this would be provided on request.
- Run `npm install` and `npm start` to install all necessary dependencies and create a local instance respectively, which should default to running on port 3000.
- Verify that your local instance is ALIVE in a browser by accessing `http://localhost:3000/`. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Testing`

- Run `npm run test` to run all tests. Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
